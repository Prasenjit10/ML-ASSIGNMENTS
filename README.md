## 📊 Datasets

The repository includes a few CSV datasets used across the assignments:
- `sample.csv`
- `sample_data.csv`
- Additional datasets extracted or generated within each notebook (e.g., weather, customer segmentation, vehicle performance).

All datasets are stored locally and loaded directly in the respective notebooks.
